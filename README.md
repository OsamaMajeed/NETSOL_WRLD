# NETSOL_WRLD
This project is a submission of assignment to a company for their hiring process.

This is a unity project that is basically helecopter flying simulator. Due to busy scedule I only added basic movements and camera follow mechanics. But I plan t continue this further when I get time. This also includes WRLD SDK for the Map.
